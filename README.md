🎯 The Perfect Guess (TPG) v5.2
A chaotic, roast-filled number guessing game made entirely in Python + Pygame.

What started as a basic CLI mini-project evolved into a full indie-style game... with UI, music, art, and an unhinged AI named Kate.
(Yes, she will roast you. No, you can't stop her.)

🚀 About the Game
This isn't your average guessing game.

You’ll get:
• 📣 Voice lines and roasts (text + TTS)
• 🕹️ Multiple game modes
• 🎨 Fully custom-made pixel art UI (Aseprite)
• 🎵 Custom music and sound effects (BeepBox + Pygame.mixer)
• 💬 Dynamic prompts, dialogues, and reactions based on performance
• And LORE??!!

Built solo from scratch. Code, art, music — everything.
This project is a love letter to gamedev, and to finally finishing what you start.

🧠 Game Modes
Normal Mode: Classic guessing, chill vibes.

Timebound Mode: Guess before the timer runs out.

Gaslight Mode: Did she just lie?

???: Unlocked through Gaslight Mode

Each mode has unique voice lines, music, logic, and personality.

🛠️ Tech Stack
• Language: Python 3.x
• Libraries:

pygame (UI, input handling, animations)

pyttsx3 (text-to-speech)

pydub (to edit some of the repetitive audio files)

random, time, os, threading, sys (core functionality)

🗂️ Project Structure
📁 audio/ → Music + SFX
📁 UI/ → Custom pixel art assets
📁 data/ → Text files for win/loss tracking & game state
📁 modes/ → Game mode logic, prompts, roasts, highscores, etc.
📁 game_icon/ → Window/taskbar icons
📄 ThePerfectGuess.exe → Main executable (in release build)

🛡️ IMPORTANT (For First-Time Launch):
When you run the game for the first time, Windows might show a "Windows protected your PC" warning.
Don’t worry — this is a common thing for indie games without a verified certificate.

👨‍💻 Made By One Dev
• Code: 100% original Python
• Art: Pixel-by-pixel in Aseprite
• Music: BeepBox bangers
• Roasts + Voice logic: Fully written + programmed manually

No templates. No teams. Just one dev, real passion (and a lot of free time I guess).

Clone or download the repo, then:

Install dependencies:

💾 Build Info
The game was packaged using PyInstaller --onedir intentionally, so players can:
